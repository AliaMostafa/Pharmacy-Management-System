# Pharmacy-Management-System
This project builds a menu-driven pharmacy ordering system with a graphical user interface using java programming language. Users can define the pharmacy's capacity, add/remove drugs with category tracking, place orders with price adjustments for cosmetics and prescription checks, track daily sales, and exit the program.
